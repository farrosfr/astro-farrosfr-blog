		Hello, I'm Farros. I'm a Cyber Security enthusiast and Web Developer with a deep passion for technology and ethical finance. This blog is where I document my journey and share what I've learned along the way.
	</p>

	<h3>My Journey into Cyber Security</h3>
	<p>
		From a young age, I've been fascinated by how things work—and more importantly, how they can be secured. My interest in cyber security isn't just a career; it's a commitment to protecting our digital world. Here, I'll be sharing detailed write-ups from my security research, CTF challenges, and insights into the latest vulnerabilities and defense strategies.
	</p>

	<h3>Building the Modern Web</h3>
	<p>
		My passion for security is matched by my love for building things. I specialize in the Jamstack architecture (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) to create web experiences that are fast, secure, and scalable. I enjoy experimenting with modern tools to push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.
	</p>

	<h3>Why Anti-Usury?</h3>
	<p>
		Beyond technology, I am a strong advocate for ethical economic systems, particularly those free from usury (Riba). This principle guides my perspective on finance and life. I believe in creating value and sharing it equitably, and I'm keen to explore how these principles can be applied in our modern, tech-driven world.
